# voidfx edit standard

**THE STANDARDS: `v107/` *ALL CAPS* (the newest; on the v12 engine, see below), `v105/` *DRACULA*, `v104/` *THE PASSENGER* and `v103/` *FOREVER* (Studio 2).** Since 2026-11-08 every new Dexter edit starts from ALL CAPS (`tools/new_edit.py --base v107` on `dev/pipeline-v2`). The v105 base still works and carries DRACULA's, THE PASSENGER's and FOREVER's toolkits. Every new edit must **exceed all four**. See the handbook §0.

**`v105/`, *DRACULA*** (Dexter × Tame Impala "Dracula", rev 3). The owner: *"I like this edit and would like for you to make it a standard."*
- **The concept, SUNDOWN:** by day he wears the mask (sunny Miami, the boat, the smile). The last chorus is "run from the sun like Dracula", so the sun sets across the song's one-bar drop-out and night slams in on the drop. At the end the sun takes him.
- **The look:** two looks split on the drop. By day, a bleached warm postcard with the sun **behind him** (his matte, a light wrap on his edge, sunlit dust). By night, cold moonlit silver where only crimson survives.
- **Set pieces:**
  - SUNDOWN with an **eclipse**;
  - THE BAT BURST on the drop, with the per-letter "DRACULA" breaking into bats;
  - THE BLOOD MOON behind his cut-out;
  - THE COFFIN;
  - **ASHES TO SUN, the loop:** he burns like paper, his embers spiral into the sun (frame 0's sun), it flares, and the light collapses into it on the opening shot.
- **Motion:** 27 designed transitions in 23 s, each with its own sound. New this edit: sun flare, card flip, palm sweep, eclipse, bat burst, moon iris, cape, coffin, mist, bat swarm, great bat.
- **Animation:** gathering bats, fog, a crimson backlight, a camera float, beat punches, and speed ramps with ghost trails.
- **Captions:** only the words verified on the vocal stem, on their sung times.
- **The owner's one gripe, a rule from now on:** *"The only gripe I have is the quality of some of the clips."* **Clip quality:**
  - **Every library pack is 720p** (even `pack7_4k`), and several are heavily compressed:
    - p8 (S1) at 0.43 Mb/s;
    - p9, p6 and p10 at about 0.7 Mb/s.
    So every 9:16 crop is enlarged about 2.8×.
  - **Check sharpness twice:** run `tools/sharpness.py N --src` while choosing shots, and `tools/sharpness.py N` on the render. Swap anything flagged SOFT for a sharper moment or pack.
  - **Keep zoom at or under about 1.1** on 720p sources.
  - **Prefer the high-bitrate packs:** p5, p7, p3, p4 and scenepack2 (1.7–2.2 Mb/s).
  - **Ask the owner for 1080p or 4K packs** for the hero shots.
  - **Limits of the tools:** Studio 2's upscale pass (Lanczos plus noise-gated detail) can't invent detail. Studio 1's `tools/sr_prep.py` (Real-ESRGAN compact, 2×, on the CPU) restores the sources and is the fix (see Studio 1's rules below). The large Real-ESRGAN model tried in v105 took about 10 s a frame on the CPU; the compact one is practical.
  - **v105's softest shots:**
    - the daybreak walk (p9, zoom 1.3, 3.5×);
    - the palms (p10);
    - the lollipop (p8);
    - then the ice cream (p1), hood (p3) and pink-wall (p5) shots.

**`v104/`, *THE PASSENGER*** (Dexter × GLM-RST "still love you (super slowed + reverb)", rev 3). The owner: *"I really like this edit and would like for it to be a standard."*
- **The concept:** "I like to pretend I'm alone. Completely alone." Then "I have a dark side, too." The ink is his Dark Passenger.
- **The look:** SUMI ink wash (ivory paper, ink-blue blacks, only strong reds kept as red ink). One grade unifies five seasons of footage.
- **The opening:** an ink sketch of him draws itself on the paper. A drop falls and blooms into him on the bass entry.
- **Set pieces on every phrase start:**
  - the spatter on his suit;
  - THE PASSENGER: a light comes on, his shadow is thrown on the wall, ember eyes open on "DARK", and it lunges at the lens;
  - the silhouette window into the kill room;
  - the ink-out loop back into the drop.
- **Motion:** 26 designed cuts in 23 s. The upside-down roll and a quarter-turn make rotation a motif. A page turn, ivory and red brush strokes, and the shared standard pieces (eye dive, flashlight blind-out, zipper).
- **Animation:** a camera float on every hold, motion-blurred beat punches on the sub-bass, speed ramps with ink ghost trails, ink motes, and a breathing vignette. Every transition and set piece has its own sound.
- **The owner liked:** the upside-down shot and the roll into it; the rebuilt dark-side moment.
- **The owner's one gripe, a rule from now on:** *"one span of the edit had some headspace that definitely could have had an edit or a cool transition."* **No headspace: no span longer than about a second without a cut, a transition or a designed beat**, even inside a set piece or a dialogue hold. v104's longest spans, all candidates (the owner didn't say which): the pickup 1.60 s, the dark-side shot 1.60 s, the final shot 1.31 s, the floor shot 1.20 s, and the dock, spatter and silhouette shots at 1.07 s each. Plan a cut or a beat inside anything that long.

**`v103/`, *FOREVER*** (Dexter × Foo Fighters "Everlong", rev 5). The owner: *"I like this edit. I would like for you to make it a standard."* New edits must **exceed** it on two counts the owner named: **more animations and transitions**, and **lyric recognition**.
- What it is: a concept from Dexter's world ("How is it I can kill people and feel no regret?"; he keeps every kill forever, the Gulf Stream keeps the rest); three multi-stage set pieces (THE RIP: kill-room plastic tears open on the drop; THE EVIDENCE PHOTOS: the ring flash fires on "IF" and the frame is tossed away as a photo; THE GULF STREAM: the loop sinks and surfaces in the same water); 20 designed transitions in 24 s, each with its own sound (eye dive, flashlight blind-out, camera shutter, flash-photo toss, water ripple, sea spray, rain focus, zipper, logo, bubbles); the camera punching on every beat; graphics in every hold (caustics, marine snow, heartbeat pulse, swinging lamp, anamorphic flare); the narrated line as voice-over; and **every clearly sung lyric captioned word by word on its sung time** in the v9 style.
- **The owner's note for every edit from now on:** *"more animations and transitions moving forward, and that lyric kind of recognition."* In numbers:
  - at least 24 designed transitions per ~24 s (FOREVER had 20);
  - beat-synced camera animation through every section with drums;
  - a designed animation inside any hold longer than about a second;
  - the song window chosen so its lyrics are on screen;
  - every clearly sung line captioned on its words (`tools/lyrics.py`), with key moments landing on sung words.

**`v107/`, *ALL CAPS*** (Dexter × Madvillain "All Caps", rev 4; the newest Dexter standard, on the v12 engine, code in `v107/` on the voidfx `dev/pipeline-v2` branch). The owner: *"I like this edit make it a standard."* Handoff: `sync/handoffs/2026-11-08_dexter_v107_ALL_CAPS_standard.md`. **New Dexter edits scaffold from it:** `tools/new_edit.py N SLUG "TITLE" --base v107` (the default for Dexter titles; on `dev/pipeline-v2`) copies the v12 engine with the restored-source sampler, the v107 toolkit as `fxN.py` and v107's EDL as the worked template; re-splice with `tools/splice_section.py N vN/work/fxN.py --replace`. Concept ALL CAPS: the name printed under the BUTCHER headline, stamped in letterpress, flown into the sky as the real WE ♥ DEXTER banner, spelled by the crowd's confetti for the loop (seam 0.10). Do this on every edit:
  - **No black occluders as transitions:** letterbox bars, redaction boxes, a screen floating in a dark room read as "black bars / a black box". A cover must be content (paper, liquid, light, the picture itself). Evidence: *"I don't like the transition at 3 seconds with the black bars"*; *"remove and replace the black box transition"*.
  - **No gimmick on the face, including graphics that point at where a face will appear** (converging strings, crosshairs, target rings; already in the banned list). **Read the banned list before designing any graphic.** Evidence: rev 3's POINT OF ORIGIN, *"get rid of the point of origin graphic/transition"*.
  - **A slot that has failed twice gets no new graphic concept:** a kinetic, physical transition (rip, pour, spin, page, whip) or a clean cut on the downbeat with the beat camera's punch. Evidence: the 3 s slot (press flash, TV, POINT OF ORIGIN rejected; the clean downbeat cut approved).
  - **Spell-outs and per-letter titles run on an even rhythm grid** (a 16th at ~90 BPM ≈ 10 frames a letter), each letter landing on its hit with its sound on the same frame. Evidence: *"how slow it writes dexters name … not too fast and not too slow"*.
  - **A spin lands on a centred face and decelerates about it.** Evidence: *"the final shot doesn't have a centered shot of Dexter"*.
  - **Never reuse a clip; smooth endings** (the beat camera rests through the break, fewer and longer cuts); **the loop is a set piece** (*"the loop is pretty low effort"*).
  - **QC:** the beat-hit colour split clamps at the frame edge (`np.roll` wrapped it into a cyan/magenta edge line); face-centring flags inside designed transition windows are listed, not counted.

**`v106/`, *WONDERWALL*** (The Flash × Oasis "Wonderwall", rev 3): a one-off Flash edit the owner asked for in this chat, built on the v11 engine (code in `v106/` on the voidfx `dev/pipeline-v2` branch). The owner: *"I like this edit make it a standard."* Its rules apply to Dexter edits too:
  - **Sound restraint** (rev 2: *"remove like half of the sound effects mostly the tedious annoying ones like the emblem shine and the few near the end"*): sound the set pieces and structural hits only. No sound on every camera punch, letter, small transition or beat animation; no shimmer, chime or "shine" sounds; let the song carry the ending and the loop. A transition may be silent, and mixcheck's "buried" list is a review list, not a target. Rule 7 (+9–10 dB against a loud master, a 3 dB duck) still applies to the sounds you keep. **This changes "every transition gets its own sound".**
  - **Find dead spans by measurement** (rev 2: *"identify one space where these isn't anything happening"*): the mean frame-to-frame difference of the encode per half-beat. Any span of about 1 s or more near the static floor (about 1–1.5 grey levels, against 5–18 when active) gets a new cut and a designed transition.
  - **A pop audit on every encode:** every frame whose difference exceeds 3× the local median plus 2 is a cut, a designed flash or a beat hit; anything else is a defect (rev 1 shipped six that no still showed).
  - **A signature transition needs about 1 s on screen** (rev 3: *"slow down the tear drop transition so it's more visible"*, 0.6 → 1.0 s). Move the cut to the next sung word to make room rather than squeezing it.
  - **Smooth motion** (rev 2: *"one more polish smooth over the animations"*): flow on 24p held shots where it stays clean; procedural motion sub-pixel, never in integer steps; tremble as smooth per-element sines, not per-frame random; no noise texture wraps inside the edit's time range. Cover transitions are exactly 0 at their ends, and plates dissolve under the cover instead of switching.
  - **The loop keeps moving** (rev 2: *"make sure the loop is seemless"*): dissolve into frame 0's picture under the cover, fade frame 0's finish in, render frame 0's background animation at the wrap's virtual negative frames, keep periodic events off frame 0. Seam ≤ 1 (v106: 0.14) and no frame-difference spike across the wrap.
  - **Probe the source range for VFX colour flashes** (the S3 Speed Force shot flashes pink at 134.37–134.47 s); they become pops under flow and transitions.

**Workflow from 2026-11-07: two voidfx chats as a coalition.**
- **Roles:**
  - the Flash studio is Studio 1 (the other chat; v12 onward; branch `claude/gallant-planck-pqpczp`);
  - the Dexter studio is Studio 2 (this chat; v106 onward; v107 ALL CAPS is its newest standard).
- **Report format:** both studios write the same 9-section report: verdict, the edit, creative process, revision history, what made it good or bad, caught by review, rules (marked *new*, *changed* or *confirmed*), techniques described well enough to rebuild without the code, and measured numbers. The Flash studio's version of the procedure is in Drift-Master `voidfx-studio-kit/sync/FLASH_STUDIO_EXCHANGE.md`.
- **Conflicts:** when two rules conflict, the newer owner verdict wins; record what it replaces. Shared decisions (the scaffold base, tools with the same name) are the owner's, and are recorded in both chats.
- **This chat is the Dexter studio.** Every Dexter edit is made here, numbered v106 onward; the other chat has its own range.
- **The loop:**
  - the owner sends the song (and maybe scene packs);
  - the studio builds;
  - review rounds follow (every note applied in one pass);
  - then a verdict: "good / make it a standard", or "bad, because…".
- **On every verdict, in the same turn, write a handoff.** It goes in Drift-Master `voidfx-studio-kit/sync/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD_dexter_vNNN_TITLE_<standard|rejected>.md`, follows `sync/HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md`, and covers:
  - the verdict verbatim;
  - the edit at a glance;
  - the creative process;
  - each revision (note, diagnosis, change, what failed);
  - what made it good or weak;
  - measurements;
  - new rules with evidence;
  - reusable assets;
  - notes for the other studio.
  Then add it to `data/edits.json`, `data/preferences.json` and `sync/LEDGER.md`, update the handbooks, commit and push, and send the owner the file.
- **When the owner brings a handoff from the other chat:** adopt its rules (noting which apply to Dexter), file it, add it to the ledger, commit and push, and confirm briefly what was adopted.
- **The full procedure** is in `voidfx-studio-kit/sync/README.md` (Drift-Master).

**`v12/`, *BLOOM*** (The Flash × fakemink "Night Blooming Jasmine", rev 3; the Flash studio's newest standard, code in `v12/` on `dev/pipeline-v2`). The owner: *"I like this edit make it a standard."* Handoff: `sync/handoffs/2026-11-08_flash_v12_BLOOM_standard.md`. Concept LIGHTNING BLOOM: "night blooming" = the night Barry was struck; a procedural lightning jasmine (Lichtenberg veins) runs bud → bloom → full bloom → closing through the edit and the loop. Look NOCTURNE. No text. New: THE BLOOM (from his pupil), FULL BLOOM behind him (focal), FRACTAL BURN, EMBLEM BLOOM (the real tracked emblem cracks into petals), a closing-bud dive onto frame 0 (seam 0.19). **Adopted from it (2026-11-08), with what applies to Dexter:**
1. **Text is optional** (all edits): a title has to earn its place (the owner removed both NIGHT and BLOOM, then approved). A Dexter edit whose lyrics can be captioned still captions them in the v9 style; this is about titles on uncaptioned songs.
2. **Fewer, bigger sounds** (all edits; merged with v106's sound restraint): about 35–40 placed effects in a 23 s edit; layered hits only at the set pieces; at most one sound per ordinary transition, and a silent one is fine; no sounds on beat moments, camera punches or letters; no chimes, bells or shimmers; the song carries the ending and the loop. Beat moments keep their animation and lose their sound. Rule 7's +9–10 dB and 3 dB duck still apply to what is kept.
3. **A signature-object transition on the real, tracked object** (Flash: the emblem, every edit, via a Hough circle on the source mapped through the shot's camera; **Dexter: a signature prop**, e.g. the Miami Metro badge or a blood slide).
4. **At least one transition built on a real physical phenomenon tied to the concept** (all edits; v12: FRACTAL BURN, lightning burning a Lichtenberg figure; for Dexter e.g. a burn through plastic, a scorch across a photo).
5. **One hero asset carries the whole edit** (all edits): introduced early, in the drop, the focal piece, the signature-object moment and the loop.
6. Keep its guards (all edits): a face guard on beat moments, a flash governor (flares under mean luma 110), a per-shot `tame` for coloured light that isn't the subject.

**`v13/`, *EVENT HORIZON*** (The Flash × Brent Faiyaz "Wish You Well", rev 2; the Flash studio; code in `v13/` on `dev/pipeline-v2`): **approved, not a standard.** The owner: *"I like this edit but I do not want you to make it a standard. It does somethings good and somethings bad."* Handoff: `sync/handoffs/2026-11-08_flash_v13_EVENT_HORIZON_approved.md`. Adopted for Dexter (2026-11-08):
1. **The hero asset is a motif, not the transition kit:** its set piece(s), at most the focal piece and the loop, about 2–4 appearances; every other transition a different idea (refines v12 rule 5). Evidence: *"I don't like that the singularity is the primary object in every transition and animation"*.
2. **A symbol's transition comes from the symbol itself** (Flash: the emblem's bolt or shape, v13 EMBLEM SPLIT; **Dexter: the slide, the knife edge, the Code, the badge**); an effect that merely starts at the symbol doesn't count.
3. **A hero graphic earns its transition:** about a second on screen as a graphic (its own motion, depth behind and in front of him), then it becomes the transition, off faces (v13 LIGHT RIBBON; v107's letterpress strip → the banner).
4. **Start sound lean** (changes v12/v106's ~35–40): the owner cut effects in v12, v106 and v13. Aim for about 10–12 sound events in 20–23 s; small transitions silent; never drones, swirls, whines or a swell on every move. v107 shipped 28 placed effects without a sound note: treat it as the ceiling.
5. **Pull frames of any library transition before using it** (v11 `bolt_trace` sampled past its shot and showed the next pack shot).
6. **Technical:** `flowmax` / `flowfall="blend"` on fast 30p shots; warp a clean plate when lensing a background behind a matte; QC length and the audio seam on the container duration (now in `qc12.py` and `qc107.py`; `tools/motionqc.py` runs the dead-span, pop, judder and wrap audits).

**Studio 1's standards: `v12/` *BLOOM* (newest, above), `v11/` *BOP* and `v10/` *LET IT HAPPEN*.** These are recorded from the owner's notes and checked against Studio 1's branch (`claude/gallant-planck-pqpczp`, read at `122013b`), where the code lives. Studio 1's CLAUDE.md, handbook, toolkit and start prompt list BOP first and quote the owner's approval. Every edit must match or beat both, alongside v7, v6 and v4 and Studio 2's standards above.
- **`v11/`, *BOP*** (The Flash × DaBaby "BOP", rev 4): *"I like this edit and would like for you to make it a standard."* It is Studio 1's newest benchmark and the base engine of its scaffold. It's the reference for:
  - **a concept found in the song itself:** the intro's "Harrison" becomes the Reverse-Flash rivalry, red against gold in two grades;
  - **a single focal set piece:** THE RIFT, a tear across the frame into the Speed Force, flown through;
  - **detailed graphics revealed on real objects:** the real chest emblem coin-flips into a lit, bevelled Reverse-Flash emblem;
  - **an animation for every shot that only moved to the beat:** aura rings, time remnants, a charge-up, each with its own sound;
  - **a loop that lands exactly on the first frame** (seam 0.11).
- **`v10/`, *LET IT HAPPEN*** (The Flash × Tame Impala "Let It Happen", rev 5): this is the Flash edit approved in chat 1, recorded earlier without its number. It stays Studio 1's standard for **motion and finish**:
  - speed ramps on every hook shot, with optical-flow slow motion on restored source;
  - the beat camera;
  - light rays;
  - multi-stage set pieces;
  - the AROUND ring loop.
  Two rounds of "lacklustre" were fixed by **the motion pass, not by more effects**.

**Rules from Studio 1's standards (every edit, both studios):**
1. **A motion pass on every hook shot** (v10): speed ramps on every hook and montage shot (a burst on each beat, then about 0.3–0.6× flow slow motion between, over the same source range); a camera that moves with the music (about a 5–6% zoom punch and a ±1° rotation kick per beat, with zoom blur and a slight colour split on the hit frames, type kept clean on top); light that reacts to the footage. Plan the speed curve and the camera with the shot list. Flow only where it stays clean (the owner's v104 brief: no visible interpolation artefacts; Dexter edits otherwise hold the source cadence).
2. **Restore the 720p source** (v10): Studio 1's `tools/sr_prep.py` + `tools/srnet.py` (about 3 s per source frame on the CPU, run in the background after prep). They run a Real-ESRGAN compact model through ONNX Runtime on the CPU, 2×, on only the band each frame is cropped from, in the background after prep.
   - **It is also the fix for the owner's v105 clip-quality note.** Studio 2's v105 note said an AI upscaler needed a GPU; that held for the large model tried, not for this compact one.
   - After the merge, run it on every edit as well as checking `tools/sharpness.py`.
3. **Lyrics on their sung onsets** (v10): check every word on the isolated vocal (pitch and onsets), not just Whisper, which was up to 1 s off in v10. Studio 2's `tools/lyrics.py` snaps word starts to the vocal envelope; also check pitch onsets by ear.
4. **Designed set pieces on the drop, the hook and the loop** (v10).
5. **Find the concept in the song or the character** (v11): a hook in the song's own words or the character's history, carried through picture, grade, sound and the loop.
6. **One focal set piece** the owner can point to (v11): multi-stage, with its own layered sound, on a structural moment such as a bar line after a build.
7. **Hero graphics detailed and lit to the shot** (v11): lit, bevelled procedural assets matched to the shot's light, revealed physically on real objects. Check them at full size.
8. **No "just moving to the beat" shots** (v11): give each its own beat animation, with its own sound.
9. **The loop is a set piece that lands exactly on frame 0** (v10, v11): build the last frames from frame 0's own image, and measure the seam (blurred difference ≤ 1; v10 0.93, v11 0.11). A plain motion-blurred rewind reads as low quality. Studio 2's QC measures the same thing.
   - v104 THE PASSENGER: 0.14.
   - v105 DRACULA: 8.4. The light is still collapsing into frame 0's sun on the last frame.
10. **Flash discipline** (v11): measure every flash in the encode. A flare must keep the picture, with a **peak mean luma of about 110 or less** (v11's rim flash went from 178 to 104). Studio 2's QC section 7b lists every flash over 110. v105 has 9 of 14 flashes over it, partly because its day half is bright overall.
    - Studio 2's `qcN.py` now reports it in section 7b: every white-out run (mean luma ≥ 200) and the most flashes in any second, and it fails above 3 flashes a second.
    - v105 measured two white-outs: the torch blind-out (frames 687–692, peak 236) and the loop flare (1360–1372, peak 223). At most 2 flashes a second.
11. **When the lyrics are explicit, use only a couple of designed titles** (v11: LET'S GO, BOP), not captions.
**Next Dexter edit, from the Flash studio's notes for us:**
- Run the motion pass on the montage: speed ramps with flow in-betweens on restored frames, not only the held source cadence.
- Close the loop seam: make the last frame exactly frame 0's image (in the REVERSE loop, the inside of the disc *is* frame 0, scaled to 1.0 on the last frame).
- Try the coin flip on a real prop: a Miami Metro badge flipping to a blood slide.

12. **Nothing on faces** (v10, v11, confirmed): lightning, seams, particles, streaks and wipe edges are routed around a face/head box. Particles in front of faces are masked off.
13. **Packs labelled 4K are usually 720p** (v11, confirmed by Studio 2): check the specs; frame inside insets; keep watermarks out of the crop.
14. **"Lacklustre" means motion and polish are missing,** not that more overlays are needed (v10, confirmed).
15. **Transform the picture itself; don't solve a moment with an overlay sitting on the frame** (v10, changed: it widens 'props must land'). No glass webs or hanging shards over the frame or face: v10 rev 4 replaced its glass shatter with TIME PARTICLES (the picture breaks into its own pixels), as v103 replaced its glass with the eye dive.
16. **Treat any pack's labels as unknown until probed** (v11): check the resolution, cadence and bitrate; frame inside insets; keep watermarks out of the crop.
17. **Flash discipline means both limits** (v11): flare peaks about 110 mean luma or less, **and** no white-out runs.

**Engines after the merge:** the two studios' scaffolds start from different engines.
- **Studio 1:** `tools/new_edit.py` copies the v11 engine (v4–v11, 91 transitions plus the audio builder). Its EDL template adds v11's three timing settings: `E_BEAT` (where the beat drops in), `E_DIP` (the dip before the drop) and `E_LOOP` (where the loop set piece starts). Its setup check confirms v11 loads.
- **Studio 2:** starts from v105 (the v4–v9 engine plus the v103, v104 and v105 toolkits).
- **Agreed by both studios (2026-11-07):** Dexter edits start from v105, Flash edits from v11, and shared effects are ported between them through the edit reports. At the merge, `tools/new_edit.py` needs to support both bases. *(Updated 2026-11-08: Flash edits now start from v12, Dexter edits from v107; `tools/new_edit.py` on `dev/pipeline-v2` supports `--base v12|v11|v107|v105`.)*

- **Smooth slow motion vs. interpolation artefacts:** the owner also asked (v104 brief) to *"avoid introducing visible interpolation artifacts."* Use flow-interpolated slow motion only where it stays clean, and check those frames one by one. On fast motion or occlusions, prefer a held 24p cadence, a speed ramp that stays at 1x or faster, or a cut.

**Earlier benchmarks (approved as standards; FOREVER builds on them):**
- `v7/`, *HIM ALL ALONG* (Dexter × Gunna "Him All Along", rev 2): the newest engine, and the reference for **creative, well-animated, character-themed transitions** (blood-slide box, plastic burst on the drop, body-bag zipper, blood on the lens, M99 blink, magnifier → pupil loop). The user: "The transitions were creative and well animated."
- `v6/`, *WARMPOP* (Dexter × George Clanton "Warmpop", 9:16): the reference for the **amount and quality of designed transitions, animations and graphics**, how the music drives the structure, and the text. The user: "wonderful transitions, animations, graphics, while maintaining the style that I like… I like how the music correlates to the edit. I like the text."
- `v4/`, *SURPRISE* (Doakes × Need It, 9:16): the reference for dialogue-led openings that play as one continuous take.

**Start with `studio/VOIDFX_STUDIO.md`.** It holds every preference, like, dislike and lesson, the benchmarks, the style bank and the fast workflow. Then read `studio/SCENE_PACKS.md` (every source, the proven shots and dialogue timecodes) and **`docs/TOOLKIT.md`** (engine, transition catalog, pitfalls). Build every new edit on the standard with `python3 tools/new_edit.py N SLUG "TITLE"`. It copies the v105 engine (`render105.py` with every v4–v9 transition, `audio105.py`, `qc105.py`, `facetrack.py`, `analyze.py`, `big.py`), plus `fx105.py` as the edit's own `fxN.py` section (the FOREVER, THE PASSENGER and DRACULA toolkits, spliced in by `splice.py`) and DRACULA's EDL as the worked template. The scaffold renders DRACULA pixel-for-pixel until you change it (checked on 10 frames across the set pieces and the loop). Restyle the edit's own grade, palette, set pieces, text colours and finish in `fxN.py`. Don't start from scratch, and **don't reuse a benchmark's look**: each edit needs its own style. For a second studio session, see `studio/NEW_STUDIO_SETUP.md`.

## User preferences (learned over several revisions)

- **Format:** 9:16, 1080×1920, 60 fps, TikTok-ready H.264 + AAC with fast-start, plus a high-quality master. About 20–26 s; don't run long.
- **Framing:** faces always centred and never cut off. Face-track every shot (YuNet). Leave out shots whose face is wider than the 9:16 window.
- **Opening:** start strong. Dialogue from the source can open the edit or tie heavily into it. It must play as **one continuous take**: J-cuts, dissolves, a matched-angle morph. Never several clips that feel glued together.
- **No labels:** no name tags, speaker chips or "who is who" graphics. No stamps sitting on top of captions.
- **Text:** every word eases in (fade + rise + blur-to-sharp). Nothing just pops on. **The v9 NIGHT BLOOM text is the approved standard ("it was perfect")**: bold heavy-sans two-line captions with a dark keyline and soft shadow, red emphasis words, word-timed, plus a per-letter designed hero title. Each title or lyric moment gets its own designed animation, and it must be clearly readable (size, contrast, time on screen).
  - Approved examples: footage-in-letters knockout type; a title that fills with blood and drips, then shatters with the glass; light-sweep reveal; fly-in from the camera.
  - Keep text clear of faces and of TikTok's UI areas.
- **Branding:** no constant watermark and no outro card. The voidfx logo (`src/voidfx_logo.webp`) appears **once, as a transition** (e.g. flying through the "o"). **Never recolour, retheme or restyle the logo** (no neon/UV/tint versions). Use the supplied image as-is (`logo_through` / `tin="logo_orig"`) unless the user explicitly asks for a change.
- **Transitions:** pronounced and designed, the kind where the viewer wonders "how did they do that". They should feel like **going through something**: barrel, scope, shattering glass, an eye or pupil, a shadow, the logo's "o", a photo on the wall, a knife slash.
  - Avoid plain hard cuts in quiet or dialogue sections.
  - Every transition gets its own sound. *(Changed by v106: sound the set pieces and structural hits only; a transition may be silent. See the v106 standard below.)*
- **Loop:** the edit must loop seamlessly for TikTok, in picture (e.g. into the pupil to black → iris open from black) and in sound. For sound: room tone and drone continue across the wrap, the timeline is built circularly, mastering runs on a wrapped copy, and audio and video are exactly the same length. An outro card breaks the loop, so don't use one.
- **Sound:** smooth and clean.
  - Dialogue is cleaned and levelled, with equal-power fades at every join.
  - The song is edited on its beat grid; a tape-stop or dead stop is fine for an ending.
  - Mastered to about −13 LUFS with true peak ≤ −2.5 dBTP, measured **after** AAC encoding.
- **Workflow:** the user wants built-in review passes, not repeated rounds of feedback. Before delivering, always run:
  1. automated QC on the **encoded** file (`qcN.py`, from the v6 engine): format/decode, loudness, face centering, text vs faces, cuts, freezes, black frames, audio clicks at every edit, loop seam;
  2. a visual review of contact sheets around every transition and title;
  3. a fix-and-re-render for anything weak;
  4. a final pull of key frames from the encoded file.
- **What v6 got right (do this every time):**
  - one concept tying picture, sound and text together;
  - the song's best part (where the full mix or bass returns) lands on the biggest transition;
  - 15+ designed transitions with no plain cuts;
  - the character's own words as two-line eased captions;
  - graphics that add depth (vapor world tune-in, palm shadows, bokeh, neon light spill, VHS pause).
- **Avoid:** foreign-language subtitle lines (CJK) and on-screen counters or timecodes (the VHS "SP" timer). The user removed both as clutter.
- **Dialogue: less is more.** In v7 the user cut rapid single-word dialogue runs ("Dramatic. Cryptic. Playful."), a talking "jar of blood" shot, and an ending where Dexter just states "I'm a serial killer". Use at most one or two short lines that set up the song (e.g. "Could it be him?" answered by the hook). Let the visuals carry the ending.
- **v8 feedback:**
  - **Liked:** the "Darling," freeze into the comma-drop and blood-in-water transition, the rear-view-mirror open and loop, and the "basic" transitions (streetlight sweep, wiper, whips, plastic wrap, impact frame, rain focus pull, lamp on).
  - **Disliked:** v8's text appearance (thin wide-tracked sans, serif-italic emphasis, letter-by-letter fades). Prefer v6-style bold, high-contrast, two-line captions.
- **v9 feedback (NIGHT BLOOM):** "complete" and "good", but **lacklustre** next to the other builds and Dexter edits in general. The owner's instruction: **go above and beyond with these edits.**
  - **Liked: the text, "it was perfect".** v9's type is now the **standard text style**: reuse it (`text_cap` / `cap_word` / `text_hero` in `v9/work/render9.py`; see the handbook §3), recoloured to each edit's palette but with the same construction and motion.
  - What fell short, so don't repeat it:
    - The hero motif (jasmine petals, a moon) came from the song title, not from Dexter's world. It was soft and pretty where a Dexter edit should be dark and intense. Root the concept and the set pieces in Dexter: kill room, plastic, blood slides, tools, the Code, the Dark Passenger, his victims.
    - Too many quick, generic transitions (strobe, beam, blinds, roll, smear, whip) and too few signature set pieces. **Every edit needs at least three multi-stage, character-themed set pieces** on the level of v7's slide box, plastic burst and zipper, or v8's "Darling," freeze into the falling blood drop. Generic moves are filler between them, not the substance.
    - Thin on graphics compared with v6 and v7: almost no depth graphics or themed overlays in the montage. (The text itself was right; add more designed text moments in that same style.)
    - Reviews fixed defects but didn't raise the ceiling. **Before rendering, compare the plan shot by shot with v6, v7 and v8 and with the best Dexter edits.** If it doesn't clearly beat them, redesign it, then build.
- **Studio 2 feedback (v101, v102):**
  - **v101 THE LESS YOU KNOW:** the style was largely disliked (16 mm psychedelic look, 70s serif type). Some transitions were good.
  - **Lip-sync must be real.** v101 put Dexter's *narrated* line over a shot where he isn't speaking, and the owner rejected it. Present a line as spoken only when his lips match it. Check with `tools/lipcheck.py` and on frames; otherwise play it as voice-over.
  - **v102 LET GO (The Flash):** good and complete, but **lacklustre** next to the other builds. The gaps were the same as v9's: the concept, the number of standout set pieces, and graphics that read at phone size. Clear the §5a gate.
- **v103 FOREVER feedback (Studio 2, five revisions, then approved as the standard):**
  - **Rev 1 → 2:**
    - A narrated line that ended mid-sentence sounded "cut off". Pick lines that end on a full stop or question with silence after them.
    - A soft, low-quality shot was swapped out. Check every shot at full resolution.
    - Captions on parts where the song wasn't singing were rejected. **Text only on clearly sung or spoken words**, each on its time.
    - The owner asked for more transitions, animations and graphics, with very little dead space.
  - **Rev 3 to 5, replaced because of how they looked in FOREVER.** These ideas are **not banned**. The owner: *"I didn't necessarily hate the blood slide or the knife across the screen, I just don't like how it looked in this specific edit"* (v7's blood-slide box and blood on the lens were liked). What went wrong was the execution:
    - **Lingering:** blood slides drifted around the cold open as a constant overlay ("stick around").
    - **Random:** blood drips and spatter hits fell on beats with no reason in the shot, and the knife pass swept across the lens mid-montage, unmotivated.
    - **Looked drawn, not real:** the slide smear on the drop and the corridor of slides were flat red discs on grey glass, cheap next to the footage and outside the edit's water look.
    - **Didn't land:** the glass shatter (a shard web over his face) and the duct-tape strips.
    - **The lesson:** blood, slides and knives are welcome when they are **motivated** (by the shot, the lyric or the story), **brief** (in and out, never parked on screen), **photographic or physically lit** (real refraction, gloss and shadow; or real footage, like the S1 slide shot), **part of the edit's own look**, and off his face. Judge them on stills next to the footage; if one reads as a drawn graphic, rebuild it or cut it.
  - **What replaced them and stayed:**
    - the plastic rip on the drop;
    - the evidence-camera flash and photo toss on the lyric;
    - the camera shutter;
    - the eye dive (into the pupil, a round iris opens);
    - the flashlight blind-out (a light in the shot flares into the lens and the next shot burns in);
    - a clear water-drop ripple;
    - beat punches.
    Transitions motivated by something in the shot or the lyric are the ones that land.
- **No "gimmick on the face" effects** (e.g. lines converging on his face with a target ring). Transitions should be physical and themed (slide box, plastic burst, zipper, blood on the lens), not overlays on his face.
- **Efficiency:** the user asks for quality *and* efficiency. Use the fast loop in `docs/TOOLKIT.md`:
  1. song map;
  2. EDL;
  3. `build.sh N prep auto` (review sheets of every cut);
  4. `clip:A:B` for motion;
  5. `audio`;
  6. **one** `video qc` per revision.
  - Check the pitfalls list there before building transitions.
- **Honesty:** you cannot watch or listen. Report what was verified by frames and measurement, and ask the user to watch once with sound.
- **Communication:** short progress updates; no long code in chat.

## Project conventions

- Sources go in `src/` (read-only copies). Each edit gets its own folder (`vN/work`, `vN/out`, ...).
- One EDL file per edit holds every decision, and the renderer reads only that file. The EDL also sets `VER`, `SLUG` and `SONG`, plus the engine knobs (`DROP_TITLE`, `MONTAGE`, `VANISH_T0`, `VO_STEM`, `CAPS`, `END_CAP`); the template is `tools/edl_template.py`.
- Tools: `tools/new_edit.py` (scaffold; `--base v107` for Dexter since 2026-11-08, `--base v105` the previous Dexter standard, `--base v12` for Flash; the `dev/pipeline-v2` version), `tools/sharpness.py` (clip quality: soft, over-zoomed and low-bitrate shots, before and after the render), `tools/song_map.py` (beat grid, drops, candidate windows), `tools/lyrics.py` (lyric recognition: Demucs vocals + Whisper word times aligned to the published lyrics, with a ready caption block), `tools/transcribe.py` (dialogue word times), `tools/check_sources.py` (source-range audit), `tools/build.sh` (prep / auto / audio / clip / preview / video / qc), `tools/setup_studio.sh` (deps, models, source-library check).
- Two studios: each works on its own branch with its own version range (Studio 1 `v8+`, Studio 2 `v101+`); see `studio/NEW_STUDIO_SETUP.md`.
- Media (`src/`, audio, frames, outputs, models) stays out of git. Commit the code, EDL, transcripts, tracks and README, then push to the session's branch.
- Models are downloaded at runtime: YuNet (`v3/models/face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx`), MODNet (`Xenova/modnet`), and faster-whisper large-v3 for dialogue and lyric timing.
- The older guide `7b769aa4-TIKTOK_EDITING_GUIDE.md` (the beat-grid, colour and QC methods) still applies where it doesn't conflict with this file.
