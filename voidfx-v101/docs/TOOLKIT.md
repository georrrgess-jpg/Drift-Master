# voidfx toolkit: how an edit gets made (fast)

The engine lives in the newest benchmark edit, `v7/work/` (HIM ALL ALONG). It contains every v4–v7 transition and graphic. New edits copy it with `tools/new_edit.py`, then write their EDL and **their own frame function** (`render()` at the end of the renderer: grade, text, graphics, finish) and sound design. **Copy the engine, not the look.** Every edit gets its own grade, type and transition mix. Owner preferences and lessons: `studio/VOIDFX_STUDIO.md`; sources: `studio/SCENE_PACKS.md`.

## 1. Pipeline and timings

Timings were measured on this 4-core box for a 26 s edit.

| Step | Command | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Scaffold | `python3 tools/new_edit.py N SLUG "TITLE"` | 1 s |
| Map the song | `python3 tools/song_map.py src/SONG.mp3 vN/work` | 3 s |
| Shot lists | `python3 vN/work/analyze.py src/PACK.mp4 TAG` (contact sheets, per-shot stats) | ~1 min per pack |
| Dialogue / lyrics | `python3 tools/transcribe.py vN NAME MEDIA [--vad] [--start S --dur D]` | 1–3 min |
| **Is he really saying it?** | `python3 tools/lipcheck.py SRC t0 t1 OUT.jpg --vocals STEM.wav [--stem-t0 S]`: face and lip crops every 0.1 s with the speech level; lips must move with the bars before a line is used as lip-synced | ~20 s |
| Voice under score | `python3 -m demucs -n htdemucs --two-stems=vocals -o vN/audio/sep CLIP.wav` | 15 s per 30 s clip |
| Tracks and mattes | `bash tools/build.sh N prep` | ~35 s |
| **Every-cut review sheets** | `bash tools/build.sh N auto` → `vN/frames/cuts_*.jpg` | ~35 s |
| Soundtrack | `bash tools/build.sh N audio` (circular, wrapped master, AAC-checked) | ~7 s |
| **Motion check** | `bash tools/build.sh N clip:A:B` → small MP4 with sound | ~20 s |
| Whole-edit preview | `bash tools/build.sh N preview` (30 fps, 540×960) | ~half the final render |
| Final + checkpoint | `bash tools/build.sh N video qc` | ~15 min + 1 min |

**Efficient loop:**
1. Write the EDL.
2. Run `prep auto`.
3. Fix whatever the sheets show, using `stills` / `clip` on single moments.
4. Run `audio`.
5. Run **one** `video qc` per revision.
6. Visual sign-off on frames pulled from the encoded MP4.

Never final-render to find out whether something works.

**Choosing the song window:** `song_map` prints whole-bar windows of 20–27 s with the biggest section change (the "good part", where the full mix or bass comes back) at 33–47 % of the edit. For Warmpop it independently found the window used in v6 (h416→h496, drop at 10.67 s).

## 2. Transitions (`tin=` on the incoming shot)

Each transition goes through something and has its own sound in `audioN.py` (`if tin == ...`).

| tin | What it does | Extra EDL fields | Sound |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tape_in` | Static → VCR roll-in while the song winds up to speed (the loop start) | — | Clunk, motor, static |
| `eye_dive` | Dives into the outgoing face's eye; the pupil swallows the frame; a hexagonal aperture opens | Face track | Heartbeat, shutter blades |
| `assemble` | The next shot builds itself from flying pixel blocks | — | Reversed crumble |
| `polaroid` | Flash; the frame freezes into a print that is tossed away | — | Flash, shutter, print eject |
| `facematch` | Face slides and scales onto the next shot's face | Face tracks | Whoosh, soft hit |
| `tear` | VHS tape tear: sliding bands with chroma fringes | — | Glitch burst |
| `crt` (+ `tout="crt"` on the previous shot) | Frame shrinks into a CRT in the vapor world; the camera dives through the screen with hyperspace streaks | — | Hum, riser, drop impact, degauss |
| `cube` | 3D cube turn over the vapor world | — | Whoosh, landing thud |
| `sun` | A striped retro sun rises; the camera flies through the stripes | — | Riser, chord swell, blind rattle |
| `filmstrip` | The frame becomes a film strip on a light table, whips to the next frame | — | Projector rattle |
| `peel` | Glossy sticker peel from the corner | — | Sticky crackle, flap |
| `ink` | A blood drop falls and splats; the stain blooms open into the shot | — | Drip, splash |
| `slash` | A blade streak cuts the frame; the halves fly apart with blood flecks | — | Swish, steel ring |
| `logo` | voidfx logo as a neon sign, flying through the "o" (**once per edit**) | — | Neon buzz, whoosh |
| `burn` | Film burn holes | — | Fire crackle |
| `lens` | The next shot reflects in the sunglasses; the camera dives into a lens | `lens=(dy, kx, ky)` on the outgoing shot | Glass chime |
| `shadow` | Darkness swallows the frame; the next shot emerges brightest-first | — | Reverse swell |
| `tv_off` | Finger-gun muzzle flash → CRT power-off → power-on | `muzzle=(x, y)` on the outgoing shot | Gunshot, power-off whine, power-on sweep |
| `slidebox_close` (v7) | Dexter's rosewood blood-slide box: the lid slams on a sung word (`CLOSE_T`), with the word engraved on a brass plate; it reopens and the camera dives into a blood drop on a slide | `CLOSE_T` | Creak, wood slam, slides rattling, latch, glass, bloop |
| `burst` (v7) | Kill-room plastic stretches toward the camera (centre-weighted bulge), then bursts into flaps with a blood spray and shock ring; the hero drop transition | Previous shot `plastic=True` | Plastic stretch, riser, rip, sub impact, splash |
| `blood_lens` (v7) | A blood drop falls and splats on the lens; the next shot is seen through it, then drips clear | — | Drip, splat, squelch |
| `zipper` (v7) | A body bag zips shut over the frame, then unzips onto the next shot | — | Zip rasp ×2 |
| `m99` (v7) | Sedative: double vision, blur, the eyelids close; they blink open on the next shot (the music is muffled underneath) | — | Heartbeats, thump, breath |
| `mag_sweep` (v7) | A magnifying glass sweeps in; inside it is the next shot, and the glass becomes the frame (`lensframe=True` on the next shot) | — | Whoosh, glass chime |
| `logo_orig` | The voidfx logo exactly as supplied, slammed in and flown through the "o" | — | Impact, shimmer, whoosh |
| `tout="rewind_end"` | The last shot rewinds at 8× → static → loops into `tape_in` | — | Tape scrub, the song scrubs backwards |
| `projector_on` (v101) | 16 mm projector strikes up from black: lamp flicker, the frame line rolls into place (the loop entry) | — | Lamp thunk, claw ticks |
| `latex` (v101) | The frame is stretched like a glove being pulled on, rips open in a ragged slit, snaps onto the next shot with an elastic wobble | — | Rubber squeak, snap |
| `frameslip` (v101) | The film loses its loop: judder, then the strip rolls up one frame (frame line + sprocket holes) onto the next shot | — | Projector clatter burst, slip, clack |
| `filmmelt` (v101) | HERO: the projector stalls, the frame scorches and blisters, burn holes with char rims and embers eat through, the white lamp light becomes the next shot on the drop. Text drawn before it burns with it (`burn=True`) | — | Crackle, sizzle, whoomp, sub impact |
| `whip` (v101) | Horizontal whip pan with speed-matched blur and chroma split | — | Whoosh |
| `hooddark` (v101) | A hood is pulled down over the lens (curved fabric rim, cast shadow) and lifts off the next shot | — | Cloth swish, thump |
| `scalpel` | The v6 blade-streak slash | — | Swish, steel ring |
| `lavalamp` (v101) | Glossy blood metaballs rise and swallow the frame, refracting it, then rise off the next shot | — | Bubbles, swell |
| `slidewipe` (v101) | A blood slide's glass slides across; the next shot is seen through the glass (magnified, smeared, frosted end) | — | Glass scrape, chime |
| `newsspin` (v101) | The next shot (a newspaper) spins in from the centre and slams down | — | Spin whoosh, paper slap, thump |
| `papertear` (v101) | The outgoing shot tears down the middle (fibrous paper edge), the halves are pulled apart | — | Paper rip |
| `oilwheel` (v101) | Liquid-light (oil wheel) cells with iridescent walls swirl over the frame; the next shot is revealed cell by cell | — | Phaser swirl, bubbles |
| `tout="reel_end"` (v101) | The film flutters, runs out of the gate, the lamp flickers through the flapping tail, black (loops into `projector_on`) | — | Projector wind-down, tail flap |

The older v4/v5 transitions are still in the file and work as `tin` values: `kaleido`, `rewind`, `flash`, `tiles`, `neon_trace`, `ripple`, `pixel_sort`, `vhs_roll`. Add new transitions to `TR2` as `fn(A, B, j, f, sa, sb)` with `(fn, frames_before, frames_after)`:
- `j < 0`: A is the live outgoing shot and B is the incoming shot's first frame.
- `j >= 0`: A is the outgoing shot's last visible frame and B is the live incoming shot.

## 3. Graphics and text

- **v101 (16 mm psych) graphics** (the owner rejected v101's overall look and type; the transitions and tools stay available, so don't reuse the look):
  - `liquid=True` (+ `seg=True`): a liquid-light show (oil-wheel cells, oxblood / plum) projected on the background behind the person matte, building through the shot;
  - `prism=True` (+ `seg=True`): prism silhouettes (amber / oxblood / plum) radiate behind the person on the bassline accents (`E.ACCENTS`);
  - film finish: gate weave, exposure flicker, red-orange halation, two-scale film grain, dust and the odd hair, warm light leaks on the montage downbeats, gentle unsharp for 720p upscales;
  - type: Fraunces Soft (OFL, `v101/fonts/`), `cap` two-line eased captions, `title` 70s layered shadow-stack letters filled with flowing liquid light that drop in on bass notes and melt out, `better` (the closing word on a freeze).
- **Per-shot knobs (v101):** `target=` exposure target (high-key shots 0.75–0.8), `warm=` pulls a cold shot into the warm stock.

- **Captions** (`CAPS`): two-line retro lockups. Each word eases in on its spoken time (fade, rise, blur-to-sharp) with pink and cyan echoes; emphasis words are chrome. The `vanish` style dissolves into pixels.
- **Drop title** (`DROP_TITLE`): a chrome word sweeps in from the left, with a light sweep.
- **End words** (`END_CAP`): neon tubes that ease in and flicker on, word by word, and spill coloured light onto the face.
- **v7 graphics:**
  - evidence markers (`markers=True`) drop in on the beat;
  - the CASE CLOSED rubber stamp (TEXT style `casestamp`);
  - the kill-room plastic layer with the luminol title (`plastic=True`);
  - the magnifying-glass lens frame (`lensframe=True`);
  - blood spatter hits on montage beats;
  - the forensic viewfinder.
- **Shot flags:**
  - `vapor_bg`: the person stands in the vapor world, then reality tunes in scanline by scanline (person matte);
  - `palms`: palm-frond shadows;
  - `motes`: bokeh specks;
  - `echo`: VHS colour trails;
  - `pause=FRAME`: VHS ‖ PAUSE freeze with jitter;
  - `vanish`: pixel-dust dissolve, timed by `VANISH_T0`.
- **Montage** (`MONTAGE` half-beat range): beat bounce, glints, light leaks and hits on the downbeats.
- **Finish:** bloom, anamorphic streak, VHS chroma bleed and scanlines, vignette, grain. The OSD is limited to PLAY ▶ at the start, ◀◀ REW at the end and ‖ PAUSE. **No SP counter or timecode.**

## 4. Pitfalls that cost time in v6 (check these first)

1. **Override layering.** `renderN.py` contains several `render()` functions, and the **last one wins**. When inserting routing with a string replace, target the active `render()` (after the "v6 frame" marker) or the change silently does nothing.
2. **Optical flow fails on lighting jumps** (police lights, flashes) and leaves dark blocky blotches. The sampler already falls back to a blend when consecutive frames differ by more than 6 levels; keep that fallback.
3. **Angle morphs can't be seamless.** Morphing an unfolded frame into a kaleidoscope fold always leaves a wedge seam. Dissolve into the full fold instead.
4. **`cv2.putText` only draws on 8-bit images.** The frames are float, so draw shapes or use the PIL `text_mask` helpers.
5. **Motion blur must match the real per-frame speed**, not a guess. The film strip smeared because its blur was about 30× too long.
6. **Face landmarks under caps and sunglasses** sit on the top edge of the lenses. Give lens transitions the real lens shape per shot (`lens=`).
7. **Faces wider than the 9:16 window** (big profiles, two-shots): check the YuNet width before picking a shot (`analyze.py` sheets print `w`) and reject anything over about 400 px of a 720p source.
8. **Titles must end before the next transition starts.** MIAMI over the cube looked broken.
9. **Quiet-section transitions and VO:** keep caption lines inside 1280–1640 px and keep them two-line, never one long line.
10. **Never wait on a full render to test a transition**: use `auto`, `stills` and `clip`.
12. **Packs hide cuts the shot detector misses** (a jump to a closer angle, the next scene starting a few frames early). Interpolating across them makes a ghost frame, and running a source range past the shot's end puts another actor on screen. The sampler now holds frames across hard cuts; `tools/check_sources.py N` (run automatically by `build.sh N prep`) now fails any shot whose source range leaks past a source cut (found twice on v7).
13. **Text vs very tight close-ups:** a face box that fills the 9:16 frame leaves no text-safe band. Swap the shot (v7: the "Could it be him?" close-up → kill-room floor) rather than shrinking the type.
11. **CJK subtitles and VHS counters read as clutter** to the user. Don't add them.

## 5. What made v6 the benchmark (carry the principles, not the look)

- **A concept that ties picture, sound and text together:** VO about disappearing, then he dissolves; the drop goes *through* a CRT; the ending confession lights up word by word; the loop is a tape rewinding into static, then the tape loading.
- **The music drives the structure:** the cold open sits on the song's filtered build, and the full-mix return lands exactly as the camera passes through the screen. Every cut sits on the half-beat grid.
- **Every transition is designed, "goes through something" and has its own sound.** No plain cuts.
- **Text is meaningful (the character's own words), eased in, two lines, and designed per moment.**
- **Built-in review passes** caught real problems before delivery, every time.
