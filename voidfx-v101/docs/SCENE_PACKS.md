# voidfx source library: scene packs, songs, proven shots

Every file lives in `src/` under the name in the first column. That folder is not in git: upload the files and rename them exactly, then run `bash tools/setup_studio.sh` to verify them against `studio/src_manifest.json`.

All times are **seconds in that file**. "w" is the YuNet face width in source pixels on a 1280×720 frame. Above roughly 400 the face is too wide for a 9:16 crop, and text has nowhere to go.

**Cached analysis** (copy it into a new edit instead of re-running):
- shot lists: `v2/work/shots_p2.json`, `shots_p3.json`; `v3/work/shots_p4.json`, `shots_p5.json`, `shots_dk.json`; `v6/work/shots_p6.json`; `v7/work/shots_p7.json`, `shots_p8.json`; `v5/work/shots_fa.json`, `shots_fb.json`;
- transcripts: `v3/work/doakes_transcript.json`, `v6/work/tr_pack6.json`, `v7/work/tr_p8.json`, `v5/work/tr_pack_*.json`, `v101/work/tr_p10.json` (pack 10, Demucs vocal stem);
- S4 packs: `v101/work/shots_p9.json`, `shots_p10.json`; `v101/work/shots_p1.json` (scenepack, 134 shots).

**Lip-sync rule:** many lines in these packs are Dexter's inner-monologue narration. Before presenting a line as spoken on screen, run `python3 tools/lipcheck.py SRC t0 t1 OUT.jpg --vocals STEM.wav` and look at the sheet: if his lips don't move with the speech bars, it is voice-over.

### `pack9_s4a.mp4` (key `p9`): S4 scene pack, 1280×720, **native 24 fps**, 3:04, 59 shots

Uploaded as `Dexter_Morgan_Dexter_S4_Scenepack_4K_1.mp4`. **Its audio track is silent** (digital zero), so it's picture only and has no dialogue. Being native 24p, slow-mo means flow interpolation; prefer 1:1 or `interp="hold"`.

| Time | Shot | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 19.42–23.38 | Lying back in a car seat, eyes half shut (after the crash) | w344, tight |
| 36.12–36.62 | **Gloved hand raised into the kill-room lamp**, looks up | w208; short, strong insert |

### `pack10_s4b.mp4` (key `p10`): S4 "all best and most popular clips", 1280×720, 60 fps container, 4:03, 102 shots

Uploaded as `Dexter_S4_4k_Scenepack_Dexter_Morgan_All_Best__Most_Popular_Clips_1.mp4`. **68% of the frames are repeats** (24p content in a 60p file), so the sampler de-duplicates it to roughly 20 unique frames per second; avoid slow-mo. 139–143.5 s is a run of near-black flash frames: avoid it.

| Time | Shot | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00–5.03 | Red-lit face in the dark (car) | w294; under "Tonight's the night" (VO) |
| 24.08–26.52 | Tank top, warm light, looks up | w161 |

| 230.57–234.05 | Red-lit, looks up at the moon | w202 |
| 238.20–239.80 | Harrison in the blood (S4 finale) | **disturbing; use with care** |

**Dialogue lines** (Whisper on the Demucs vocal stem, `v101/work/tr_p10.json`; word times approximate, so check the stem before use). **Most of these are inner-monologue voice-over: run `tools/lipcheck.py` before presenting one as spoken.**
